## Chapter 2: Advice ##

Stoick had gathered the Vikings into the main hall decorated with tapestries and a huge golden dragon statue being impaled by a knife. He stood at the main table with a fire pit in the middle. He had a map displayed for those around him to see.

"Either we finish them, or they're finishing us! It's the only way we'll be rid of them. If we find the nest and destroy it, the dragons will leave. They'll find another home." He pulled a knife and stabbed the map. "One more search, before the ice sets is."

"But those ships never come back."

"We're Vikings, it's an occupational hazard. Now who's with me?" Nobody spoke up. Instead they whispered words to each other. "Ok, those who stay will look after Hicca and make sure she stays out of trouble."

Everyone immediately raised their hands. "I'm with you Stoick." Said Spitelout.

"That's more like it!"

The meeting was dismissed and Stoick walked to his close friend, Gobber and sat next to him. "I'll pack my undies."

"No, I need you to stay and train some new recruits."

"Oh perfect. And while I'm busy, Hicca can run the forge. Molten steel, razor-sharp blades, lots of time to herself. What could possibly go wrong?"

"What am I going to do with her, Gobber." Stoick sighed.

"Put her in training with the others."

"No, I'm serious."

"So am I."

"She'd get hurt before you even let the first dragon out of its cage!"

"Maybe that's because you've spent her entire life hiding her from danger, shielding her from the world. Besides, you don't know that."

"I do, actually."

"No you don't." said Gobber.

"Actually, I do."

"No, you don't!" Gobber said with more force.

"Listen, you know what she's like. From the minute she could walk, she's been…different. She doesn't listen, she has the attention span of a sparrow. I take her fishing and she goes hunting for…trolls!"

"Trolls exist." Gobber turned. "They steal your socks. But only the left ones, what's with that?"

"When I was a boy" began Stoick.

"Oh here we go again!" Gobber mumbled.

"My father told me to bang my head against a boulder and I did it. I thought he was crazy, but I didn't question him. And you know what happened?"

"You got a headache?" Gobber asked amusedly. During that little trip down memory lane, he took a sip out of his mug and his fake tooth in his mouth. And he put it back into place and used his mug to hammer it to make sure it stayed in there.

"That rock split in two." Stoick corrected. "It taught me what a Viking could do Gobber; he could crush mountains, level forests, and tame seas." He sat down next to his friend. "Even as a boy, I knew what I was and what I have become…" he hanged his low, "Hicca isn't the kind of person that can do those things."

"You can't stop her Stoick, you can only prepare her. You won't be able to hide her from the world forever. I know it seems hopeless but you won't always be around to protect her. She's going to get out there again. She's probably out there now!"

But what they didn't know was that what Gobber said was very much true...
