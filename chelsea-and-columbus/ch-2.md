## Chapter 2 ##

I don't know if Columbus is the one. I am going to wait on it.

"Happy 4th of July," I said. It was dawn.

"Yeah. Too bad there is nobody to set off fireworks. Plus, that is a really bad idea, considering the zombies," Columbus replied.

"Sheesh, killjoy. I was just saying."

"I know. Sorry."

"It's okay. I am used to stuff like that. Dealt with it my entire life you know."

Columbus tilted his head questioningly. I nodded, "Yup. My family was awfully depressed. They didn't really care about holidays, or my peppy spirit at times."

"Oh, I didn't know. Sorry."

"Nah, its fine. Don't really care 'bout it."

As we drove, we saw another car going by. It was a yellow hummer, "That's Tallahassee," Columbus said. I looked over. As he drove by, he had a gun pointed at us. I stopped the car, and so did he, "Hello there Tallahassee. My friend Columbus here has told me so much about you," I said.

"And, you are you?" he asked.

"Her name is Chelsea. From New York. She is driving me the rest of the way to Columbus," Columbus stated. Tallahassee nodded, "Okay. Good luck petunia, LOOK OUT!" he yelled. He lifted his gun, and fired at a zombie running at my open window. The bullet grazed the side of Columbus' shoulder before it hit the zombie. Columbus howled in pain, and gripped his shoulder, "What did you do that for? You could have killed him!" I yelled.

"It was either just hit on the shoulder, or eaten by a zombie! I just saved your God dang life!"

"Well then, let's see how you like it! OH LOOK OUT!" I said mocking him. I shot my handgun right past him, and it grazed his other shoulder, "Deal with it," I said before driving away.

"I pulled the truck over as soon as he was out of sight, "Are you okay? Let me see!" I said. I moved his hand, and the wound was large. It was bleeding real badly, "Okay. Keep that pressure on it, and I will get my first aid bandages!"

I climbed into the back seat, and pulled out my plastic kit. I opened the box, and pulled out the bandages. Columbus moved his hand so I could put it on. I put it around the wound tightly, "You will be fine. We just need to keep moving, before the zombies smell the blood. Columbus slowly nodded. I was now very worried about him, "You didn't have to shoot him. He meant no harm," he said.

"He didn't seem to care that he hurt you, so I don't care if I hurt him."

"I know, but... He could die now."

"I was going to go back after I got you fixed up to help him," I said turning the car around to go where I saw him last. The hummer hasn't moved since we last saw it. When I looked in the driver's seat, Tallahassee was leaning back, gripping his shoulder. I looked at him, and then looked at Columbus, "Do I have to?"

Columbus shot me an annoyed look, "Fine!" I said. I pulled out my bandages, and got into his car. Tallahassee didn't look happy with me, and I didn't blame him. He pulled up his gun, and pointed it at me. I put my hands up, so he could see I was just holding bandages. I put the bandages on his shoulder, his gun against my head. Columbus watched, his shotgun in hand, in case Tallahassee decides to fire. When I was done, I put my arms up again, "I am sorry, but if you hurt him again, it will be worse than this," I said getting out. Tallahassee shot me an angry look before driving away.

"Happy?" I said when I got in. Columbus nodded, "You said if you saw him dead, you wouldn't care."

"Well, I lied. He isn't that bad," he replied.

"Yeah sure. He shoots you, and you say he isn't that bad."

"Okay, when you put it like that!" he said smiling. I laughed, "Yeah, that's what I thought," I turned the truck around, and started driving. We drove in silence for a while. I looked over at Columbus, and noticed he was looking at me. I blushed, and looked back to the road. Columbus did the same. Columbus glanced back at me for a few seconds, and looked back out the window.
