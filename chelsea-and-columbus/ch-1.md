## Chapter 1 ##

Hi, I am Chelsea. From Chelsea, New York. (no that is not my real name. just my character from zland). I have long golden blond hair, and deep blue eyes. When the virus struck. It took everybody with it. I have been looking all over the country to find somebody without blood dripping down their face, and skin falling off every two seconds. I wish every night, that somebody. A special somebody will find me. I will cry sometimes. I will get angry, and kill things at times. It depends on how the thought makes me feel. Upset, that it is probable that nobody is out there, or angry that the zombies killed them all. I just... I don't know what to do.

I pulled up to a gas station, and pulled out my handgun as I walked inside. I could really use a bag of sour cream and onion chips. I walked down the snack isle, and grabbed a few bags,"Oo! Corn nuts!" I said as I picked up the cool ranch bag. I grab a twinkie, before bolting out the door, and into my black Chevy truck. At the moment I was in Texarkana, but I saw nobody. Accept for a few zombies here and there, or a few bodies on the side of the road, half eaten,"Quite the exotic road kill," I said to myself. I heard a suit case rolling not far behind me. I turned around, with my gun pointed. The rolling stopped, and I heard a shotgun pump. It didn't take long for me to notice what I was looking at. It was a boy. About 16 years old. He was bleeding a little on his lip, but not enough to be a zombie. Just a right cross or something. I gave him a thumbs up, to show I was human. He cautiously did the same, and I put my gun down. As the thumbs up, he cautiously did the same. This boy had short, curly dark hair, and dark brown eyes. He looked a little on the frightened, but lonely side.

"Do you have a car?" I asked as I walked up to him.

"Umm... No.. I don't have a car," he replied.

"Do you need one?"

"That would be nice."

"Then get in," the boy walked over the the truck, and got into the front seat.

"Chelsea. I'm Chelsea," I said.

"I-I'm Columbus," he stated. I nodded,"Cool. I am guessing your headed to Columbus?"

"Yeah. Where are you going?"

"I was just looking for a friend, and I found you," Columbus smiled,"I thought I was the only human left in Zombieland."

"You call it Zombieland too?" he asked.

"Yeah. What else is there to call it? You can't have a country without people, and there are no people here."

"I saw the exact same thing."

We sat in silence for a while, and I started up the truck,"I wil give you a ride to Columbus if you want, so your not in danger of zombies. Walking is very dangerous," I said.

"Yeah, I know. Tallahassee said that he would drive me to Texarkana, and that was it."

"There is another human?"

"Yeah. If your anything like me, you would not enjoy his company. He is very hard to get along with, and he enjoys zombie killing, like it's a sport!"

"Sounds like a jerk."

"You have no idea."

I started to drive the car. It was night time, so it was hard to see all of his features. He seemed nice enough, and he was a lot like me,"How did you get that cut on your lip?" I asked.

"Tallahassee. I thought we were getting along well enough. I thought he could drive me a little farther. I guess not. He literally threw me out of his Cadillac. That's how I got it."

"Ouch! He really is a jerk, huh?"

"Yeah. Well, if I see him dead, I wont care!" he said with a smile. I smiled back,"How old are you?" he asked.

"14. What about you?"

"I am 15."

"Cool."

"We are getting a little to comfortable around each other. We need to stop," I said. Columubus nodded,"Right... You need to cut off all emotional ties, and care about your own survival."

"Yup," I replied. I continued driving. I wanted to get to know him more, but if I did, he could turn into a zombie, or get eaten by one, and I would be sad. Sadness is vulnerability. I know I said I wanted to meet a special guy, but I am not sure this is the one. He could be a friend, but nothing more. Maybe he could be something less. Could turn out to be an enemy. Some people play nice at first, then they go ballistic, and take all your guns, ammo, and car. All of your means of survival. I am just going to wait it out on this one.
