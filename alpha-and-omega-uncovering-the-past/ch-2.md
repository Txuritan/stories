## Chapter 2: The Hunt ##

**Kate POV**

After waking up I was ready to hunt.

I have a good feeling about today's hunt and i could taste the caribou in the air.

Just then I saw Lilly.

"Hey, sis are you finally going hunting?" I half teased, half asked.

"Sure I'll give it a shot for once. But I just came to get some flowers for tonight's moon light howl" replied Lilly.

"Oh no I totally forgot!" I cried.

"Oh don't worry Kate, I'm very sure Humphrey didn't forget," Lilly gestured.

"Now maybe we should get going for the hunt"

So we headed off and establish our posts. Lilly and Bax (a new alpha we got) and I in the west.

They drove the caribou towards us and...

We ambushed them.

It seemed simple enough so we went for it.

"Hey I think I hear them coming" warned Lilly and she was right.

In just seconds I saw them coming two hundred yards away.

Within a matter of seconds we attacked... then the next I'm lost with my memory.

So I went looking for someone and I did.

"Hey you... yes you I need your help" I called to him.

**Caileb POV**

"Oh man I've be spotted" I thought to myself. Then a wave of relief...

She wanted my help.

"What do you need" I asked with my claws at the ready.

"Yes who am I and where am I? And-" But i cut her off.

"Shut up," I commented "I'm a lone wolf, so I don't know you and we're in the western half of the west/east territory... but since you seem to have forgotten everything, I will let you hang with me but keep your distance" I said.

"Oh... thanks. You're so kind" she said smiling and blushing.
