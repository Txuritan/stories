## Chapter 4: On The Run ##

**Kate's POV**

"Hey... umm?" I asked.

"My name is Caileb." He said.

"Ok Caileb were are we?" I asked "We're in the Southern Pack Territory and yes I know that you are not from the Southern Pack because I was head alpha only a few months ago." Caileb answered.

"So what happened?" I asked curiously.

"Well there was a food short-edge and I was banished," Caileb explained "so here I am had they let me explain that the caribou left for the white march and we could have smashed ice to get to some fish and few would have starved."

After listening to Caileb's story I felt heartbroken and somehow ever since I met him... in... LOVE. Just as I was about to tell him there was a rustle in the trees.

"By the way I forgot to tell you they are super angry and have been hunting me down." Caileb added. "Maybe we should hide?" I suggested. "Agreed." Caileb answered and vanished into thin air.

Then a mysterious voice yelled angrily from behind me, "Who are you and what are you doing here?" I slowly turned around and answered, "I don't know who I am or why I'm here."

"What do you mean you don't know!" The wolf snapped at me. "You know what? I am feeling generous so I'll ask one more time. Who are you and why are you here?"

"I told you I don't know!" I yelled.

"Well, Well, Well. Looks like we have a stubborn little omega." The wolf pointed out.
"What was that?" I snarled.

"You herd me right... stubborn... little... OMEGA!" He screamed " What are you going to do about it omega?" Seconds later I was pounding them to the ground and when I got my paws on the leader I said "Take it back or I'll shove your brain down your throat!"

"I take it back! I take it back!" He wined cowardly then they are off.

When I turned around Caileb is standing behind me with his mouth hanging open... then... I kissed him.
